#summary Original source codes of the game

= Original version  =

Quite amazingly a hard copy of the original source codes survived the years. I scanned the pages and then passed them through OCR software. The codes as shown contains numerous typos since apparently OCR do not work well on dot matrix fonts. 

The original version of the game was programmed in BASIC. With that many goto statements and minimal comments/explanations, the codes are quite difficult to follow. Perhaps some may appreciate how messy it was to write (and debug) computer programs back in those days.
