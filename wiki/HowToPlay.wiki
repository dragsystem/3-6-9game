= Quick start =

A simple game to test your wits, this app is. Use the menu bar to start a new one-player or two-player game. Then two players take turn marking one open square on a 9-by-9 board. Whoever make joining three, six, or nine squares scores those points. One may think of this game as a generalized tic-tac-toe. Obviously the player with the higher score wins. 


= Details =

Get to the menu bar to start a new one-player or two-player game. Players take turns. Double tap a square to mark it and begin playing. Make rows, columns, or diagonals of exactly 3, 6, or 9 to score. Highest score wins.
